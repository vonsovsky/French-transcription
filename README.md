# French-transcription
French phonetic transcription in Prolog (SWI-Prolog mutation).

## Usage

Launch the script by `[trans].`

Load set of rules by typing `nactiDatabazi.`. `transkripce.` sets up mode for the text transcription.

## Issues

I am unable to run the script on current version of SWI-Prolog. Anyone knows how to update the code to the latest version?
